Repository Version: 10 June 2020

This dataset includes group-level results from multifold parametric analyses of a high-resolution fMRI
approach-avoidance conflict anxiety task (n = 19). SPM Results are divided in primary 
analyses using a 8 mm FWHM smoothing kernel, and secondary (localization)
analyses using a 4 mm FWHM kernel. 

Parametric modulators of BOLD activation were set up with serial orthogonalization in the following order:<br/> 
P1: TP, TM, TP x TM<br/>
P2: A, TP, TM, A x TP, A x TM, TP x TM, A x TP x TM<br/>
P3: Two separate analyses for approach and avoidance trials. Order of modulators as in P1.<br/>

Abbreviations:<br/>
TP = threat probability<br/>
TM = threat magnitude<br/>
A = action (approach / avoidance)

and behavior in a human approach-avoidance conflict anxiety task (submitted)
